online service that operates via websites and mobile apps.Launched on May 5, 2003,[5] 
the platform is primarily used for professional networking and career development, and 
allows job seekers to post their CVs and employers to post jobs. From 2015 most of the company's 
revenue came from selling access to information about its members to recruiters and sales professionals.

LinkedIn has 830+ million registered members from over 200 countries and territories.[4]

LinkedIn allows members (both workers and employers) to create profiles and connect with each other in an 
online social network which may represent real-world professional relationships. 
Members can invite anyone (whether an existing member or not) to become a connection. LinkedIn 
can also be used to organize offline events, join groups, write articles, publish job postings, 
post photos and videos, and more.[7]
